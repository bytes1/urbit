## Summary

<p>The Urbit notify app is a tool that allows users of the Urbit network to receive notifications from various apps without having to actively access or be logged into their "ship," which is the individual node or identity within the Urbit network.This allows users to stay informed of any important updates or events happening within the apps they use on the Urbit network, and they can respond to those notifications</p>
<p>
This app works by routing notifications from different apps on the Urbit network to a user's ship and relaying them through the notify app. This enables users to receive updates and alerts even when they're not actively using their ship or the apps in question.
</p>
<p>
One of the key features of this app is its ability to integrate with other apps, enabling users to receive notifications from a variety of sources in a single place. Currently, it is integrated with MetaMask, a popular Ethereum wallet, using a feature called "snaps".
</p>
<p>
Overall, The Urbit Notify app is an useful utility that brings the much needed convenience and security to users by allowing them to receive and interact with notifications from different apps in the Urbit network without accessing their ship, also allowing them to intergate with any other apps for receiving notifications.
